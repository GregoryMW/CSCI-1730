Name of Programs: FP_A.cpp, FP_B.c, FP_C.cpp, FP_D.cpp

This is a set of four programs that solve four challenges found on Project Euler (projecteuler.net). Each of these four are REQUIRED to have one .txt called with them
in the command line parameters, with each program having its own specific file for testing purposes.

Coder: Gregory Woolsey

How to compile: (FP_A) - g++ -g -Wall FP_A.cpp -o FP_A
       		(FP_B) - gcc -g -Wall FP_B.c -o FP_B
		(FP_C) - g++ -g -Wall FP_C.cpp -o FP_C
		(FP_D) - g++ -g -Wall FP_D.cpp -o FP_D

OR use the included makefile
make
